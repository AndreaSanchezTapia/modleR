# modleR: a workflow for ecological niche models <img src="articles/modleR.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

__modleR__ is a workflow designed to automatize and document some of the common steps when performing ecological niche models (ENM). Given the occurrence records and a set of environmental predictors, `setup_sdmdata()` prepares the data by cleaning for duplicates, removing occurrences with no environmental information and applying some geographic and environmental filters. It also partitions data into test and training sets, using crossvalidation or bootstrap procedures. `do_any()`or `do_many()` fit the ecological niche models using several algorithms, some of which are already implemented in the __dismo__ package (Hijmans et al 2017), and others come from other packages in the R environment, such as glm, Support Vector Machines (__kernlab__ and __e1071__) and Random Forests (__randomForest__). A function to join individual partitions in several ways is provided in `final_model()`. Finally, `ensemble_model()` assembles models from distinct algorithms and provides summary rasters.
