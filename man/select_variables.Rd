\title{Helper function to select environmental variables from a stack.}
\usage{
select_variables(predictors, buffer = NULL, cutoff = 0.8,
  percent = 0.8)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictors}{An object with the rasters to be cut.
Accepts an object of type RasterStack, generated by the function \code{\link[raster]{stack}}.}

\item{buffer}{Raster specified by the user or output from create_buffer()}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff value of correlation between variables to exclude environmental layer.
Default is to exclude environmental variables with correlation > 0.8}

\item{percent}{percentage of the raster values to be sampled to calculate the correlation.
Default is to 0.8 but should be useful with high resolution rasters}
}
\value{
A RasterStack of independent environmental variables based on a
 specific cutoff
}
\description{
This function takes a stack of environmental variables and the calibration area.
The function calculates Pearson correlations between all environmental variables and
returns a new stack with uncorrelated variables based on a cutoff.
}
\examples{

## selecting data for only sp1
coord1sp <- coordenadas[[1]]
## selecting only columns with longitude and latitude
occ <- coord1sp[,c(2,3)]
## using coord1sp to create buffer w/ mean distance between points
buf <- create_buffer("foo", occ, predictors=example_vars)
## running select_variables w/ output from create_buffer
select_variables(predictors = example_vars, buffer = buf)

## selecting variables for the entire area with a different cutoff
select_variables(example_vars, cutoff=0.5)
