\arguments{
\item{species_name}{A character string with the species name. Because species
name will be used as a directory name, avoid non-ASCII characters, spaces and
punctuation marks.
Recommendation is to adopt "Genus_species" format. See names in
\code{\link{example_occs}} as an example}

\item{occurrences}{A data frame with occurrence data. Data must have at least
 columns with latitude and longitude values of species occurrences.
See \code{\link{example_occs}} as an example}

\item{predictors}{A Raster or RasterStack object with the environmental
raster layers}

\item{lon}{The name of the longitude column. Defaults to "lon"}

\item{lat}{The name of the latitude column. Defaults to "lat"}

\item{models_dir}{Folder path to save the output files. Defaults to
"\code{./models}"}

\item{real_absences}{User-defined absence points}

\item{buffer_type}{Character string indicating whether the buffer should be
calculated using the "\code{mean}", "\code{median}", "\code{maximum}"
distance between occurrence points, or an absolute geographic
"\code{distance}". If set to "\code{user}", a user-supplied shapefile will be
used as a sampling area, and \code{buffer_shape} needs to be specified. If
NULL, no distance buffer is applied. If set to "\code{distance}",
\code{dist_buf} needs to be specified}

\item{dist_buf}{Defines the width of the buffer. Needs to be specified if
\code{buffer_type = "distance"}. Distance unit is in the same unit of the
RasterStack of predictor variables}

\item{env_buffer}{Logical. Should an euclidean environmental filter be
applied? If TRUE, \code{env_distance}, and \code{max_env_dist} or
\code{min_env_dist} need to be specified. Areas closest than
\code{min_env_dist} and farther than \code{max_env_dist} in the environmental
space will be omitted}

\item{env_distance}{Character. Type of environmental distance, any in
"\code{centroid}", "\code{mindist}". Defaults to "\code{centroid}", the
distance of each raster pixel to the environmental centroid of the
distribution. When set to "\code{mindist}", the minimum distance of each
raster pixel to any of the occurrence points is calculated. Needs to be
specified if \code{env_buffer = TRUE}. Maximum or minimum values need to be
specified (parameters \code{max_env_dist} and \code{min_env_dist})}

\item{buffer_shape}{User-defined buffer shapefile in which pseudoabsences
will be generated. Needs to be specified if \code{buffer_type = "user"}}

\item{max_env_dist}{Numeric. Sets a maximum value to exclude the areas
farthest (in the environmental space) to the occurrences or their centroid,
expressed in quantiles, from 0 (the closest) to 1 (the whole range of
environmental distances). \code{max_env_dist} has to be larger than
\code{min_env_dist} or no values will be left}

\item{min_env_dist}{Numeric. Sets a minimum value to exclude the areas
closest (in the environmental space) to the occurrences or their centroid,
expressed in quantiles, from 0 (the closest) to 1 (the whole range of
environmental distances). \code{min_env_dist} defaults to 0.05, excluding
areas belonging to the 5% closest environmental values. Note that since this
is based on quantiles, and environmental similarity can take large negative
values, this is an abitrary value. \code{max_env_dist} has to be larger than
\code{min_env_dist} or no values will be left}

\item{min_geog_dist}{Optional, numeric. A distance for the exclusion of the
areas closeste to the occurrence points (in the geographical space). Distance
 unit is in the same unit of the RasterStack of predictor variables}

\item{write_buffer}{Logical. Should the resulting RasterStack be written?
Defaults to FALSE}

\item{seed}{Random number generator for reproducibility purposes. Used for
sampling pseudoabsences}

\item{clean_dupl}{Logical. If TRUE, removes points with the same longitude and
latitude}

\item{clean_nas}{Logical. If TRUE, removes points that are outside the bounds    #' of the raster}

\item{clean_uni}{Logical. If TRUE, selects only one point per pixel}

\item{geo_filt}{Logical, delete occurrences that are too close to each other?
See \insertCite{varela_environmental_2014;textual}{modleR}}

\item{geo_filt_dist}{The distance of the geographic filter in the unit of the
predictor raster, see \insertCite{varela_environmental_2014;textual}{modleR}}

\item{select_variables}{Logical. Whether a variable selection should be performed. It excludes highly correlated environmental
variables. If TRUE, \code{cutoff} and \code{percent} parameters must be specified}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff value of correlation between variables to exclude
environmental layers
Default is to exclude environmental variables with correlation > 0.8}

\item{percent}{Numeric. Percentage of the raster values to be sampled to calculate the
correlation. The value should be set as a decimal, between 0 and 1.}

\item{plot_sdmdata}{Logical, whether png files will be written}

\item{n_back}{Number of pseudoabsence points. Default is 1,000}

\item{partition_type}{Character. Type of data partitioning scheme, either
"\code{bootstrap}" or k-fold "\code{crossvalidation}". If set to bootstrap,
 \code{boot_proportion} and \code{boot_n} must be specified. If set to
 crossvalidation, \code{cv_n} and \code{cv_partitions} must be specified}

\item{boot_n}{Number of bootstrap runs}

\item{boot_proportion}{Numerical 0 to 1, proportion of points to be sampled
for bootstrap}

\item{cv_n}{Number of crossvalidation runs}

\item{cv_partitions}{Number of partitions in the crossvalidation}

\item{...}{Other parameters from \code{\link{create_buffer}}}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with the groups for each run (in columns called
cv.1, cv.2 or boot.1, boot.2), presence/absence values, the geographical
coordinates of the occurrence and pseudoabsence points, and the associated
environmental variables (either all the layers or the selected ones if
\code{select_variables = TRUE}).

Function writes on disk (inside subfolder
at \code{models_dir} directory) a text file named sdmdata.csv that will be used
by \code{\link{do_any}} or \code{\link{do_many}}
}
\description{
This function takes the occurrence points files and the predictor layers and
executes data cleaning, data partitioning, pseudo-absence point sampling and
variable selection according to their correlation. It saves the metadata and
sdmdata files into the hard disk.
