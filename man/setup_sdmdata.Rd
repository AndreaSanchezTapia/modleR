\arguments{
\item{species_name}{A character string with the species name. Because species name will be used as
a directory name, avoid non-ASCII characters, spaces and punctuation marks.
Recommendation is to adopt "Genus_species" format. See names in \code{\link{coordenadas}} as an example.}

\item{occurrences}{A data frame with occurrence data. Data must have at least columns with latitude an longitude values of species occurrences.
See \code{coordenadas} as an example.}

\item{predictors}{An object with the rasters to be cut.
Accepts an object of type RasterStack, generated by the function \code{\link[raster]{stack}}.}

\item{models_dir}{Folder path to save the output files.}

\item{real_absences}{User-defined absence points.}

\item{lon}{The name of the longitude column. Defaults to "lon".}

\item{lat}{The name of the latitude column. Defaults to "lat".}

\item{buffer_type}{Character string indicating whether the buffer should be
calculated using the "mean", "median", "maximum" distance between occurrence
points, or an absolute geographic "distance". If NULL pseudoabsences are randomly generated in the entire area
of the RasterStack of predictor variables.
filled with predictors. If set to "distance", "dist_buf" needs to
be specified. If set to "user", "buffer_shape" needs to be specified.}

\item{dist_buf}{Defines the width of the buffer. Needs to be specified if buffer_type = "distance".
Distance unit is in the same unit of the RasterStack of predictor variables}

\item{env_buffer}{Logical. Should an euclidean environmental filter be executed? If TRUE, \code{"env_distance"} and \code{"max_env_dist"} need to be specified.}

\item{env_distance}{Character. Type of environmental distance \code{"centroid", "mindist"}. The default is \code{"centroid"}.}

\item{dist_min}{Optional, a distance for the exclusion buffer
Distance unit is in the same unit of the RasterStack of predictor variables}

\item{buffer_shape}{User-defined buffer shapefile in which pseudoabsences will be generated.
Needs to be specified if buffer_type = "user"}

\item{max_env_dist}{Numeric. Quantile set as maximum environmental distance. Needs to be specified if env_buffer = TRUE}

\item{write_buffer}{Logical. Should the resulting raster file be written? defaults to FALSE}

\item{seed}{Random number generator for reproducibility purposes. Used for sampling pseudoabsences.}

\item{clean_dupl}{logical. If TRUE removes points with the same longitude and latitude}

\item{clean_nas}{logical. If TRUE removes points that are outside the bounds of the raster}

\item{clean_uni}{logical. If TRUE selects only one point per pixel}

\item{geo_filt}{Logical, delete occurrence that are too close? see \code{\link[modleR]{geo_filt}}}

\item{geo_filt_dist}{The distance of the geographic filter in the unit of the predictor raster, see \code{\link[modleR]{geo_filt}}}

\item{select_variables}{Logical. Whether a call to \code{\link[modleR]{select_variables}}.
should be performed. This function excludes autocorrelated environmental variables. Cutoff and percent parameters can be specified}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff value of correlation between variables to exclude environmental layer.
Default is to exclude environmental variables with correlation > 0.8}

\item{percent}{percentage of the raster values to be sampled to calculate the correlation.
Default is to 0.8 but should be useful with high resolution rasters}

\item{plot_sdmdata}{Logical, whether png files will be written.}

\item{n_back}{Number of pseudoabsence points. Defauls is 1,000.}

\item{partition_type}{Perform bootstrap or k-fold crossvalidation?}

\item{boot_n}{How many bootstrap runs.}

\item{boot_proportion}{Numerical 0 to 1, proportion of points to be sampled.
for bootstrap.}

\item{cv_n}{How many crossvalidation runs.}

\item{cv_partitions}{Number of partitions in the crossvalidation.}

\item{...}{Parameters from \code{\link{create_buffer}}.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame with the groups for each run. (in columns called cv.1, cv.2 or boot.1, boot.2), a presence/absence vector, the geographical coordinates, of the occurrence and pseudoabsence points, and the associated environmental variables. Function writes on disk (inside subfolder at \code{models_dir} directory) a text file named sdmdata that will be used in \code{\link{do_any}} or \code{\link{do_many}}.
}
\description{
This function takes the occurrence points files and makes the data cleaning,
data partitioning and the pseudo-absence point sampling, and saves the
metadata and sdmdata files into the hard disk.
